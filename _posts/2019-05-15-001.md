Recently, I have been performing a lot of sysadmin tasks that require a user to
either be interactive with the task, or to not do anything during the task. 

I have been researching how to schedule these tasks, while also scheduling the
message to be seen by all logged in users. 

This has got me much more used to using crontab to schedule these tasks. 

If you have not used crontab to schedule jobs, I will give a mile introduction. 

---

According to the cron man pages, cron is a daemon to execute scheduled
commands, whereas crontab is the program that maintains crontab files for individual
users. 

I will not be going into using @daily, @weekly and such. I am only going to go
over how to quickly and easily schedule a job to run from the root user. 

The first thing to check is if you already have any cron jobs running for any
user. 

This can be done with the command:

```
crontab -u <username> -l
```
Where crontab is the command, the -u option says to specify a user and the -l
option is to list all running cron jobs for that user. The -u option assumes
that you are the root user and specifying a different user. If you are just
running the list command as a regular user, you would only need to execute:

``` 
crontab -l
```
When you run these commands, the output should look something like:

```
* * * * * <some job>
```

Where some job is the specific job that you want to run. In this example,
I will be using a bash script called test.sh so it would look like:

```
* * * * * /bin/sh test.sh
```

Now for the asterisks, these are the time specific variables to tell the cron
daemon when to execute the job. (by the way, job, command, function are all
going to be used interchangeably in this article, they all mean something to run)
Here is a little breakdown of how these time variables work...(I just grabbed
a picture of this breakdown because I did not want to type it out myself) 

![cron job layout](/assets/crontab-layout.png)

The best way to think about this breakdown is to say the *nth* of the *nth*
whatever. So we we wanted to make this script run everyday at 5:30am, it would
look like:

```
30 5 * * * /bin/sh test.sh
```

The first thing I want to point out is that the asterisk stand for a wildcard
default selection, so if all five variable were asterisks, it would mean run
every minute, of every day, of every month, of every year. 

So with the example above, we can deduce the meaning to be run at the fifth
hour and the thirtieth minute of everyday, in every month, in every year.

I hope that is enough information to help you understand the basics of
scheduling cron jobs.

For the script that I want to run to echo some message to a user, my first
assumption were to write a script that looks something like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Some message"
``` 
However, this script will echo the message, but only into the users mail spool,
which would only be viewed if that user decided to actually look inside the
mail spool, by using the command mail. 

After some researching, I found the command, wall, which according to the man
pages will write a message to all users. 

At this point, all I had to do was change the *echo* in my script to *wall*, so
it looks like:

```
#!/bin/bash
wall "Hello User!"
```

and voil√†. We can now schedule cron jobs that will echo a message to any
specified user.
