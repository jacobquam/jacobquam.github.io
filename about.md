I am a NIX lover and passionate to learn about how things work. I started
off my career doing security stuff. Worked as a pentester and a SOC analyst and
now I explore all the possibilities and use cases for NIX in all scale
environments. 

I am currently working to pursue the RHCSA/RHCE/Ansible certifications and
thought that my blog would be a good place to share my learning experience and
even help others pursuing the same certifications. The blogs will be varied in
length, depth, and topics ranging from simple Linux/BSD commands to in-depth
security implementations and everything in between. I am not an expert by any
means, I simply have a passion to share what I learn. 

If you want to share ideas, give input on any blog post or just chat about
technology, feel free to contact me via twitter @cog1tar3. If you are
responding to a specific blog post, please start with the blog post number.
